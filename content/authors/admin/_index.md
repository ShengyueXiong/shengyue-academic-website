Hi, my name is Shengyue Xiong (熊声悦). I’m a first-year PhD student at Northwestern University in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, where I studied speech and brain sciences in {{<staticref "https://soundbrainlab.northwestern.edu/people/">}} Soundbrain Lab {{< /staticref >}} under the supervision of Prof. Bharath Chandrasekaran. My research interests lie in the neural mechanisms underlying speech perception in adverse conditions. I hope to conduct research using an interdisciplinary, behavioral, neurophysiological, and computational approach during my doctoral study. 

I received my master degree in 2022 from University College London’s Program in Language Sciences (Speech Sciences), where I was mentored by Prof. {{<staticref "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/patti-adank">}} Patti Adank {{< /staticref >}} in the Division of Psychology and Language Sciences. My master thesis focused on the specific role of phonological processing on perceptual adaptation to noise-vocoded speech under a dual-task paradigm, finally earning a Distinction grade.

I also worked with Prof.Peter Gordon in the Language and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at Columbia University after my master year, supporting an EEG study on language processing in people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). I gradually cultivated my interests in disordered populations.

Before I went to the UK, I got my Bachelor’s degree in English Literature and Linguistics at Shandong University in China. Upon graduation,  I joined THUNLP group as a research assistant at Tsinghua University, working on Corpus Construction. Then worked with Prof. {{<staticref "http://paslab.phonetics.org.cn/?p=581">}} Aijun Li {{< /staticref >}} in the Laboratory of Phonetics and Language Sciences in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, conducting research on phonetic annotation and speech acquisition mechanisms.
